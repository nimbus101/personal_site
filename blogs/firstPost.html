If you are reading this article then I could safely assume that you also like to travel and explore all the cool places that this world has to offer. I would like to know why you want to travel and what it means to you. I should, however, reserve that topic for some other day.</p>

<p>Today, I want to talk about how I managed to get a one-way to Sao Paulo Brazil for $11.20. I think that was a heck of a deal and I would like to share my steps so someday soon you will also be able to get awesome deals like this!</p>

<h4>So lets get started!</h4>

<b>It all starts with money!</b>

<p>All right, before you stop reading let me explain myself. I do not have a secret formula for you so you can travel the world for free. That is just not realistic. It does take money but not as much as we think and if we are smart about managing our money it gets even easier.</p>

<h4>Smart management of our money, huh? Tell me something I don’t know Sherlock!</h4>

<p>This is probably the hardest part for most of us and the most important! Do not get trapped into the cycle of debt. Do not carry any balances on your credit card. This is very important because credit cards plays an important role on making our travel dreams possible, which I am going to discuss in details down below. </p>

<h4>Easier said than done right? You bet it is!</h4>

<p>So what are the ways to claim our financial independence? There are many resources out there that teach you how to manage your finances so you can work towards being debt free like books (Ramit Sethi, Toni Robbins), podcasts (Tim Ferriss Show, Freakanomics), countless articles in the internet (use your best judgment). Please do check out some to see what works for you and follow through! I personally have a simple rule that I live by and that works perfect for me. I will gladly share that with you.</p>

<p>With every paycheck that I earn, I take out 20% and put it in savings right away. That is my way of paying myself first. I don’t remember who the guest speaker was but I heard this on Tim Ferriss Podcast couple of years ago and it just clicked. Most of us spend all of our money on bills, and other miscellaneous expenses and tell ourselves that we will save whatever is leftover at the end. This never works because we almost always spend it all.</p>

<p>Let’s say that you earn $1000 a week, and the number doesn’t matter, take out $200 right away and put it in your savings. Now you are left with $800. Calculate all of your monthly expenses that are unavoidable. These are your reoccurring bills. These are actually easier to manage because you can foresee them. You know exactly how much you will be spending on them. Take out 60% from the original amount to pay for those expenses. This means you have set aside $2400 per month to pay for your monthly expenses. If you are realistic with your lifestyle with a $1000 weekly income, then that should be plenty of money to sustain your living. This leaves you with $200 a week to spend on anything that your heart desires. Now, these numbers and percentages are not set in stone and work with it based on your earnings and lifestyle, but if you can manage with somewhat similar version of it then you should be in good shape. If you are able to follow though on this then congratulations! You just earned yourself your favorite mocha choca latta frappe from your favorite coffee shop. Do not feel guilty or let anyone tell you that you cannot indulge yourself in your favorite drink. You deserve it! Maybe your body won’t like it so much but that’s a different topic. </p>

<p>You can decide to follow this simple plan to get started or subscribe to other sophisticated financial planner, it doesn’t really matter as long as you are committed to it and are consistently following through. Whatever path you choose the end goal is the same—financial freedom!</p>

<p>Now that we have taken care of that lets talk about next step. </p>

<h4>Credit Cards! — Necessary evil!</h4>

<p>There are countless articles on the web that geeks out on how to make the most out of our credit cards. I do advise you to read some of them because they have very good pieces of information. Some that crosses my mind are The Points Guy, David Simmons (youtube) It is very essential to know how to use credit cards to your advantage so you can earn all the bonus points to work towards your travel. </p>

<p>One credit card that I swear by at this moment is Chase Sapphire Preferred. The reason I like this credit card is the connection it has with most of the major airlines and the points transfer is 1:1. What this means is that every points that you have on chase is transferrable to any partnered airlines and your points will reconverted without any devaluation. 1 point will be converted to 1 airline mile. Now, it is pointless to get these cards if you cannot meet the requirements to get the sign up bonuses. Chase Sapphire currently offers 50,000 points as a sign in bonus if you spend $4000 in first three months of account opening. </p>

<p>Your logic should not be to spend that $4000 to get the points because that would be foolish. Rather you should wait until the time you know you have a major expenses coming up in your life. For example, I signed up for Sapphire Preferred just before my cousin’s wedding because I knew that, “WE” will have major spending next couple of months. The good thing about that situation is that the spending is not exclusively personal. I talked to all of my family members to make sure that I cover most of the expenses through my credit card and they reimburse me after the dust has settled. This way I have more than enough transactions to qualify for that sign up bonus and I didn’t really spend that $4000 myself. Clever? I think so ;)</p>

<p>Now that you managed to snag that sweet bonus points, your mindset should stay the same. Every outings you have with your family and friends that you trust, try to use that same logic so you accumulate points in return. The rewards will not be as huge as the initial bonus points but every little one adds up. </p>

<p>Before we move on I want to reiterate the point I previously made— pay off your credit card end of each month! If you cannot then do not use it! If they manage to catch you in their cycle of interest fees then we have failed. None of this will matter or makes sense.</p>

<p>Now, assuming that we have successfully passed up to this stage of the game, lets discuss on the next topic!</p>

<h4>Memberships!</h4>

<p>Subscribe to become a member of every major airline that you usually travel with.</p>

<p>Subscribe to become a member of every major hotel that you usually stay at. </p>

<p>Subscribe to become a member of every major car rental companies that you usually rent from. </p>

<p>What our mindset should be is that since we’re spending money for their services anyway, why not get everything that we possibly can with that money in addition to the services that we paid for. This will payoff in bundles when you accumulate enough points to make a difference.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to have a job for a past couple of years where I had to travel frequently for work. This allowed me to accumulate airline, hotel, and car rental points on behalf of my company’s dime. It generally helps of you stick with just one company in each category so you can accumulate points faster. It will also help you climb their status ranking faster resulting on additional amenities— which are always sweet!</p> 

<p>What if your job doesn’t require you to travel as frequently? What if you don’t fly that often in your normal life? That’s still okay!</p>

<p>It will certainly take longer to accumulate points but it is not impossible. Use the same logic I mentioned previously. Volunteer to pay for flights for your trusted family and friends. If they don’t care about the airline miles or hotel points it’s even better— don’t let them go to waste. Pay for their flights, book their hotels and apply your membership numbers to them. Slowly and steadily you will build your points.</p>

<p>Now that we have worked on all of these things we are ready to merge these accounts and start making our travel plans!</p>

<h4>Let’s make it happen!</h4>

<p>Once that you have decided where you want to go, start looking for tickets! The more in advance you plan the cheaper it gets as a general rule of thumb. Good places to start are those usual travel sites. Search for tickets and see what options you have to gauge what you are working with. If you have Sapphire Preferred then this is a good time to go through Chase portal and check what options you have available. One good thing about booking tickets through Chase is that you get more bang for your buck. Meaning every 50,000 points would be redeemable for $500 just as any other credit cards, but if you use those points towards your travel then you can get tickets up to $625 for those same points. Chase shows you all their travel partners that have flights to your destination and how much it costs. </p>

<p>Now that we know how much it costs for the tickets through Chase and other online agents, it is time to make a good use of those memberships that we signed up for. Login to those partnered airlines and search for the tickets through their award portal. Airlines usually have different ways to evaluate how much it cost on their miles to get from point A to point B, therefore definitely shop around. Now, that you have searched how much it costs (in miles) from all of the airlines it’s time to choose the airline that allows getting to our destination with the least amount of points. After we have made our selection, let’s transfer those points that we have accumulated through our credit card. Hopefully, now you should have enough miles in your respective airline to get the tickets you so desire!</p>

<p>With few variances this is usually my procedure on finding the best price possible.</p>

<p>If you made it this far then thank you so much for reading! I hope I was helpful on making your dream trip come true.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns please do email me and I would love to discuss with you or help you out in anyway I can. </p>

<p>Safe travels!</p>
